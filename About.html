                    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                    <h3>My name is Sonam Dorji and I am thrilled to be pursuing my passion for technology and problem-solving through a Software Engineering degree at the Royal University of Bhutan. With a lifelong fascination for understanding how things work, I have found my calling in decoding the logic and art of well-crafted software.

                        Through dedicated self-study and a rigorous academic program, I have become proficient in foundational languages like Python and gained valuable hands-on experience building projects from the ground up. But I know there is always more to learn in this rapidly evolving field. That is why I am seeking an internship opportunity where I can fully immerse myself in the software development lifecycle and excellence in engineering.
                        
                        I am particularly excited to learn how large-scale solutions are architected, optimized and translated into code. Collaborating with experienced mentors and teams would provide invaluable insight into real-world development workflows. My problem-solving skills, eye for detail, and passion for continuous learning make me well-suited to positively contribute to impactful technology projects. I am ready and eager to dive in and start applying my potential to build innovations that make lives better.</h3>
